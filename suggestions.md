# Suggestions

- Add some styling
- Maybe add a completed list where you can mark it completed and move it to another list?
- Add a manual delete button to each item

## When you're feeling a bit more confident

- Add a database where you can store todo and completed items
- This can be done with localStorage or sessionStorage as well (easier than it sounds)
